🚧 **Under Construction** 🚧

</div>

A modular game engine built on top of [TypeGPU](https://typegpu.com) & [Koota](https://github.com/pmndrs/koota), pushing the capabilities of JavaScript/TypeScript in graphics and general-purpose GPU compute for game development.

## Packages
- [wayfare](/packages/wayfare) - the engine itself.
- [Bionic Jolt (common)](/packages/bionic-jolt-common) - a game project that drives the initial set of features that *wayfare* should have (3D primitives, collision detection, cameras, etc...).

## Apps
- [Bionic Jolt (web)](/apps/bionic-jolt) - a web embedding of the Bionic Jolt game.
- [Bionic Jolt (react native)](/apps/rn-bionic-jolt) - a mobile embedding of the Bionic Jolt game.
